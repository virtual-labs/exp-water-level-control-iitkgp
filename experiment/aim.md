### Aim of the experiment
Study and operation of coupled tanks in two different configurations.</li>
1. Configuration-1:

the control challenge is to track to a desired trajectory the water level in the top tank (i.e. tank 1) from the voltage applied to the pump.

2. Configuration-2:

The coupled-tank system in configuration-2 is an example of state coupling. In configuration-2, the control challenge is to track to a desired trajectory the water level in the bottom tank (i.e.tank 2) from the water flow coming out of the top tank (i.e. tank 1).
