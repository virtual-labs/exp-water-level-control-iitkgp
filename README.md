### About the Experiment 
**System description**

The Coupled-Tank plant is a "Two-Tank" module consisting of a pump with a water basin and two tanks.To name a few,industrial applications of such Coupled-Tank configurations can be found in the processing system of petro-chemical, paper making, and/or water treatment plants.In this experiment, the Coupled-Tank system is used in two different configurations, namely configuration-1 and configuration-2. In configuration-1, the control challenge is to track to a desired trajectory the water level in the top tank (i.e. tank-1) from the voltage applied to the	pump. The coupled-tank system in configuration-2 is an example of state coupling. In configuration-2, the control challenge is to track to a desired trajectory the water level in the bottom tank (i.e.tank-2) from the water flow coming out of the top tank (i.e. tank-1)
Proportional-plus-Integral-plus-Feedforward-based water level controllers are used In the present experiment.Depending on the tanksâ€™ configuration and coupling,the purpose of the laboratory session is to regulate and track the water level in either tank-1 and/or tank-2.
