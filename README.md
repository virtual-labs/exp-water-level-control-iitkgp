### About the Experiment 
**System description**

The Coupled-Tank plant is a "Two-Tank" module consisting of a pump with a water basin and two tanks. Industrial applications of such Coupled-Tank configurations
can be found in the processing system of petro-chemical, paper making, water treatment plants etc. In this experiment, the Coupled-Tank system is used in two different
configurations, namely configuration-1 and configuration-2.<br/>

In configuration-1, the control task involves accurately following a specified trajectory for the water level in the top tank (i.e. tank-1)
based on the applied voltage to the pump.<br/>

In configuration-2, the control task is to accurately trace a specified trajectory for the water level in the bottom tank (i.e. tank-2) using the water flow discharged from the top tank (i.e. tank-1).

Proportional-plus-Integral-plus-Feedforward based water level controllers have been used in the present experiment. Depending on the tanksâ€™ configuration and coupling,
the purpose of this experiment is to track the water level in either tank-1 or tank-2.
