### Aim of the experiment

1. Study and operation of coupled tanks in two different configurations.
				
 i) Configuration-1 :

The control task involves accurately following a specified trajectory for the water level in the top tank (i.e. tank-1) based on the applied voltage to the pump.

ii) Configuration-2 :

The control task is to accurately trace a 
specified trajectory for the water level in the bottom tank (i.e. tank-2) using the water flow discharged from the top tank (i.e. tank-1).
